# Carbon-Footprint-Calculator
This is a European Erasmus Project developed for the Object Oriented Programming Course.
The goal was to create an application which enabled users to calculate their carbon footprint. There are three categories that this project tackles: transportation, allimentation and household consumption. This way, the method of calculating one individual's carbon footprint is more precise. The application is a Web application, coded mainly in C++ and React. It uses the Crow library for linking backend (C++) to frontend (React).
The implementation of this project has lasted for a whole semester, getting docummentation on the topic and actually coding the app. During these three months, the team got familiar with OOP principles, but also learned how Crow and React work.
